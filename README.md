# P2 - Platypodes COVID-19 Project 
* Welcome to our Trimester 2 project for COVID-19. 
* With the recent rise of COVID numbers, we want users to be informed of the extent to which COVID is harming populations.
* We wanted to make a interactive tracker to make COVID-19 data accessible to all in order to keep others educated about the crisis. 
* Other websites may be a bit difficult to navigate especially when cluttered with other health news rather than purely COVID-19 news. That's why we aim to create this clean website that will show you all the COVID-19 information that you will need to know!
* Learn more about our plan in the Project Plan below.

### Project Plan
* Here is where we started, we made a plan of action and hope to follow it closely and make this a COVID-19 tracker to be recokened with.

### Scrum Board
* Big Ticket items are layed out here for the fundamentals of our project that are nonegotiable.
* Some parts of the scrum board include minor bits that can be taken out if necessary. This is an easy way to track the progress and how far we are getting into the project. It can also be used to recognize lagging behind in our project and straighten up before the deadline.

### Project Log
* **12/11/20**: 
* **12/10/20**: Updated README.md of this repository and worked further on expanding Project Plan and getting it closer to the completion. Worked mostly on adding Big Ticket Items to scrum board and making sure everything is staying on track
* **12/09/20**: Worked on Project Plan and formulating ideas for implementing project. We learned more about SQLAlchemy and brainstormed ideas to use that in our project for creating the databse with the scraped data.
* **12/08/20**: Created project plan document and added minor items to begin the thought process and workflow thinking for our project.
* **12/04/20**: Brainstormed more ideas about project and was approved by the teacher. Our new idea will be a COVID-19 tracker that will be in an aethetically pleasing website. The database will be automatically updated. This process of database updates is explained in further detail in our scrum board and project plan which we will begin work on next week.
* **12/03/20**: Thought about project ideas for this trimester and came up with an ASCII Database with many games, arts, animations all based on ASCII and designed to implement database workflow.
