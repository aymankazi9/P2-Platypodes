# P2 - Platypodes COVID-19 Project 
* Welcome to our Trimester 2 project for COVID-19. 
* With the recent rise of COVID numbers, we want users to be informed of the extent to which COVID is harming populations.
* We wanted to make a interactive tracker to make COVID-19 data accessible to all in order to keep others educated about the crisis. 
* Other websites may be a bit difficult to navigate especially when cluttered with other health news rather than purely COVID-19 news. That's why we aim to create this clean website that will show you all the COVID-19 information that you will need to know!
* Learn more about our plan in the Project Plan below.

### Scrum Board
* Big Ticket items are layed out here for the fundamentals of our project that are nonegotiable.
* Some parts of the scrum board include minor bits that can be taken out if necessary. This is an easy way to track the progress and how far we are getting into the project. It can also be used to recognize lagging behind in our project and straighten up before the deadline.

### Project Log
* **12/20/20**: New file added called stats.py. Used stats.py to create a databse stemming from the web scraped data that was created through iteration. More explanation of iteration of web scraped data into lists can be explored within code comments of the project. 
* **12/18/20**: Fully functional dropdown menu (finally!). CSS colors to add aesthetic to website that matched the image. Landing Page is complete and matches vision in aesthetics. Map test, developed a map that allows users to navigate throughout the trackers by the click of a map link in a visual representation.
Note: WIP test, this is not going to be the final result let alone the final trackers. Trackers for the website will most likely consist of states in the United States rather than cities in California or other major cities.
* **12/17/20**: Model.py and Jinja calls are fixed, issue with the classes that needed to be created. Source dictionary can now be successfuly pulled into templates. 
* **12/15/20**: Website run commands moved to wsgi.py for more ergonomic and inline functions. App routes are now being recgonized, issue caused by minor typo. New templates added and are linked to navbar in base.html. No content in these templates, they only extend from base as of right now. Added templates: newspage.html, loginpage.html, aboutus.html)
* **12/14/20**: Navigation bar added, worked on backend integration to the base.html navbar. More html templates coming soon to add more pages to the website. Issues: Website isn't working, issue with app routes, must be resolved in the future
* **12/11/20**: Completed the Project Plan and have all roles assigned to group members from the scrum board. Some peripheral goals are yet to be assigned, but those are in the final parts of this project. 
* **12/10/20**: Updated README.md of this repository and worked further on expanding Project Plan and getting it closer to the completion. Worked mostly on adding Big Ticket Items to scrum board and making sure everything is staying on track
* **12/09/20**: Worked on Project Plan and formulating ideas for implementing project. We learned more about SQLAlchemy and brainstormed ideas to use that in our project for creating the databse with the scraped data.
* **12/08/20**: Created project plan document and added minor items to begin the thought process and workflow thinking for our project.
* **12/04/20**: Brainstormed more ideas about project and was approved by the teacher. Our new idea will be a COVID-19 tracker that will be in an aethetically pleasing website. The database will be automatically updated. This process of database updates is explained in further detail in our scrum board and project plan which we will begin work on next week.
* **12/03/20**: Thought about project ideas for this trimester and came up with an ASCII Database with many games, arts, animations all based on ASCII and designed to implement database workflow.
* **12/01/20**: Repository was created, README.md added. No updates to README.md file or Repository as of yet. Users added from the team in order to begin work.
