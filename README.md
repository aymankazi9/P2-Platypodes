# P2 - Platypodes COVID-19 Project 
* Welcome to our Trimester 2 project for COVID-19. 
* This pandemic has been the bane of many people for the majority of 2020 causing the loss of plans, loss of loved ones, and loss of important events. 
* We feel this great annoyance and wanted to wanted to make a fun tracker to make COVID-19 data accesible to all. 
* Other websites may be a bit difficult to navigate especially when cluttered with other health news rather than purely COVID-19 news, that's why we aim to create this clean website that will show you all the COVID-19 information that you will need to know!
* We have planned a great ordeal of tasks throughout this trimester to get done and hopefully come up with a beautiful website that will track COVID-19 through the use of web scraped data and with personalized news based on your nation.
* Learn more about our plan in the Project Plan below.

### Project Plan
* Here is where we started, we made a plan of action and hope to follow it closely and make this a COVID-19 tracker to be recokened with.

### Scrum Board
* Big Ticket items are layed out here for the fundamentals of our project that are nonegotiable.
* Some parts of the scrum board include minor bits that can be taken out if necessary. This is an easy way to track the progress and how far we are getting into the project. It can also be used to recognize lagging behind in our project and straighten up before the deadline.
