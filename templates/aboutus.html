            <p class="card-text"> Hi, my name is Pragadeesh and I'm currently a junior in Del Norte High School. Throughout my high school career,
                I have been very passionate about medicine and availability of medical information to all. During COVID-19,
                many people are unaware of certain aspects of the virus and the implications. Therefore, this computer science
                project was the perfect opportunity to create a COVID-19 tracker and make details about the virus known
                to a large audience.
